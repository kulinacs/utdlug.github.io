Bring a laptop and join us on this interactive lecture! We will discuss public cloud providers, walk users through setting up a trial account* on AWS, and help you started with your own cloud server!

<span style="font-size: 10px">* To participate in this optional step, you will need a credit-card associated with your Amazon account. You will not be charged as long as you stay in the free tier's monthly allotment.</span>

UPDATE: We have uploaded the [slides](/uploads/aws/AWS_part_1.pdf) from the event.
