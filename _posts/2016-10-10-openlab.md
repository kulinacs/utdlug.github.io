### Saturday October 15, 2016 / 5:00PM - 7:00PM ECSS 2.306

Join us in our Open Lab to work on your Linux-related projects in a friendly and helpful environment. Linux workstations will be provided, but feel free to bring your own computer.

After this event, we plan on continuing to have open labs every other Saturday, in-between regular meeting events.
