### Saturday February 25, 2017 / 4:00PM - 7:00PM ECSS 2.201

Join the LUG as we walk you through the most common parts of a web application stack, including the web server, scripting engine, and persistence layer. This meeting continues to build on the skills and concepts from our last AWS meeting, but does not require prior attendance.

UPDATE: We have uploaded the [slides](/uploads/aws/AWS_part_2.pdf) from the event.
