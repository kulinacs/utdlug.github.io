Do you like trivia?  Come join us and test your knowledge of the less technical parts of Linux.  Alternatively, come and get a good laugh as we try to run a game show!

UPDATE: Miss the fun?  You can still see our jeopardy boards online:  [Board 1](/uploads/jeopardy/board1.html),  [Board 2](/uploads/jeopardy/board2.html)
