Join us for a fun event all about cryptography!  Come learn how encryption is used in the real world, generate some private keys, encrypt a folder, send a secure email, and discover how Linux makes all this easy.

UPDATE: We uploaded the [slides](/uploads/cryptoparty/cryptoparty-slides.pdf) and [handout](/uploads/cryptoparty/cryptoparty-handout.pdf) from the event.
